    "## ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Alzheimer's disease (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily affects older adults and is the most common cause of dementia.\n",
    "* The earliest clinical manifestation of AD is selective memory impairment and while treatments are available to ameliorate some symptoms, there is no cure currently available.\n",
    "* Brain Imaging via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is used for evaluation of patients with suspected AD.\n",
    "* MRI findings include both, local and generalized shrinkage of brain tissue. Below is a pictorial representation of tissue shrinkage: ![braintissue](https://github.com/ads-predict-early-alzheimers/project2/blob/main/Alzheimer's_disease_brain_comparison.jpg?raw=1)\n",
    "* Some studies have suggested that MRI features may predict rate of decline of AD and may guide therapy in the future.\n",
    "* However in order to reach that stage clinicians and researchers will have to make use of machine learning techniques that can accurately predict progress of a patient from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.\n",
    "* We propose to develop a sound model that can help clinicians do that and predict early alzheimer's."

    "# 3. RELATED WORK\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The original publication has only done some preliminary exploration of the MRI data as majority of their work was focused towards data gathering. However, in the recent past there have been multiple efforts that have been made to detect early-alzheimers using MRI data. Some of the work that was found in the literature was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Machine learning framework for early MRI-based Alzheimer's conversion prediction in MCI subjects.** [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this paper the authors were interested in identifying mild cognitive impairment(MCI) as a transitional stage between age-related coginitive decline and Alzheimer's. The group proposes a novel MRI-based biomaker that they developed using machine learning techniques. They used data available from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) Database. The paper claims that their aggregate biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9020 in discriminating between progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Noteworthy Techniques:\n",
    "   1. Semi-supervised learning on data available from AD patients and normal controls, without using MCI patients, to help with the sMCI/pMCI classification. Performed feature selection using regularized logistic regression.\n",
    "   2. They removed aging effects from MRI data before classifier training to prevent possible confounding between changes due to AD and those due to normal aging.\n",
    "   3. Finally constructed an aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining age and cognitive measures about MCI subjects by applying a random foresst classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning.** [4] \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The authors of this paper have proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for MRI images of brains based on eigenbrains [(eg.)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/138015/fncom-09-00066-HTML/image_m/fncom-09-00066-t010.jpg) and machine learning. In their approach they use key slices from the 3D volumetric data generated from the MRI and then generate eigenbrain images based on [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) data. They then used kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization. The accuracy of their polynomial kernel (92.36 $\\pm$ 0.94) was better than their linear (91.47 $\\pm$ 1.02) anf radial basis function (86.71 $\\pm$ 1.93) kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Support vector machine-based classification of Alzheimer’s disease from whole-brain anatomical MRI.** [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this paper the authors propose a new method to discriminate patients with AD from elderly controls based on support vector machine (SVM) classification of whole-brain anatomical MRI. The authors used three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI images from 16 patients with AD and 22 elderly controls and parcellated them into regions of interests (ROIs). They then used a SVM algorithm to classify subjects based upon the gray matter characteristics of these ROIs. Based on their results the classifier obtained 94.5% mean correctness.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The possible downfalls of their technique might be the fact that they haven't taken age related changes in the gray matter into account and they were working with a small data set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "We have described 3 papers over here that we found the most interesting, however there are a few more that have explored the same question. Regardless, it is worthwhile to mention that the above papers were exploring raw MRI data and we, on the other hand, are dealing with 3 to 4 biomarkers that are generated from MRI images."

    "## 7.B UNIQUE APPROACH\n",
    "The uniqueness of our approach is the fact that we would be including metrices like MMSE and Education also in our model to train it to differentiate between normal healthy adults and those with Alzheimer's. MMSE is one of the gold standards for determining dementia and hence we think it is an important feature to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same fact also make our approach flexible enough to be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases which are diagnosed using a combination of MRI features and cognitive tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.C IMPLEMENTATION\n",
    "The teams' primary intention was to explore how machine learning can make a difference in the clinical environment. For that we have developed a web program using our algorithm which can be used anyone regardless of their programming experience. By using a [CGI module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgi.html) we want to make everyone take advantage of your effort!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\n",
    "* CGI can be used make a webserver execute your model.\n",
    "* The input arguments for your web program should be the same as the parameters you used to train your model.\n",
    "* The idea is that a Clinician should be able to input MRI results, biographic data and other parameters for a patient. Your model should assist them in identifying dementia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here is the [screenshot](https://pitt.box.com/s/a0wvujqqbbtt97qri1pqo06mw28rwjlb) of our web application\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.D LIMITATIONS\n",
    "There are limitations in implementing a complex model because of the quantity of the dataset. Even though the nature of each feature is evident, the ranges of each group's test value are not classified well. In other words, we should have identified more clearly the differences in the variables which might have played a role in the result.The predicted value using the random forest model is higher than the other models. It implies there is a potential for higher prediction rate if we pay more attention to develop the data cleaning and analysis process. Moreover,  the perfect recall score 1.0 of SVM 1.0. Indicates that the quality and accuracy of the classification might decrease dramatically when we use different dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  7.E FURTHER RESEARCH\n",
    "The main takeaway for us is that there are several key factors which are caused by Dementia and we should continue to check it and clear the process in different ways.For the further study, it is necessary for us to improve our understanding through more sophisticated EDA process with a larger sample size. For instance, we would try not only the age itself but also group it into generation, or grade volume of brain tissue or exam scores. If the results from this process are reflected in the data cleaning process and positively affect the decision making of the model, the accuracy of the prediction model can be further improved."
