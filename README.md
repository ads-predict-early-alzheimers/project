Automated decision-making systems (ADS) are omnipresent in today’s healthcare systems.
They help in providing accurate, critical, cost and time-efficient solutions to a wide array of
medical conditions which led to their widespread adoption. However, it would be naive to
underestimate the issues such systems face in a real-world setting. Such systems are prone
to various biases and errors. Institutional biases stemming from race, gender, age, income,
and ethnicity are endemic in Healthcare. In this study, we are conducting a technical audit
of an ADS predicting Early Alzheimer’s trained on the OASIS (Open Access of Series of
Imaging Studios) dataset having a total of 807 MRI scans of 566 patients across OASIS-1
and OASIS-2 datasets
